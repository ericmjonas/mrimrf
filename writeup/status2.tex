I have finished reading both Frey's ``Phase Unwrapping for MR'' paper
as well as ``MRF's for MRI's: Bayesian Reconstruction of MR Images via
Graph Cuts.''  by Ramin Zabih in CVPR'06, where they extend the use of 
MRFs beyond phase. It's an interesing approach, and I will keep it in 
mind throughout my project. 

My initial attempt at coding up the MRF from scratch (using C++
wrapped in Python) is proceeding well. I'm still considering dragging
out the MRF compiler I wrote for a paper we submitted to NIPS last
year -- on one hand, one of my advisors really wants me to finish up
that project for an additional submission, but I don't recall the code
being in that great of a state when we left off. So it's on the radar, 
but unlikely for this project. 

On the other hand, we had some approximation of replica exchange monte
carlo working in it, and getting that working in a stand-alone context
can be tricky as well. I'll hopefully have this figured out by the end
of the week.
